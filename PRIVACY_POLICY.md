# ClipTrack Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

## Overview
ClipTrack is a clipboard history manager extension that operates 100% locally on your device. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Storage
ClipTrack collects and stores the following data **locally on your device only**:
- Text content that you copy, cut, or paste
- Source URL and page title where clipboard actions occurred
- Timestamps of clipboard events
- User preferences and settings (theme, tracking options, etc.)
- Custom tags and favorites you create
- Templates you save

**Important:** All data is stored exclusively in Chrome's local storage on your device. We do not transmit, upload, or share any of your clipboard data with external servers.

## How We Use Your Data
Your clipboard data is used solely to:
- Display your clipboard history within the extension
- Enable search and filtering functionality
- Generate usage statistics (calculated locally)
- Provide export functionality (files are saved to your device only)

## Data Sharing
We **DO NOT**:
- Collect any personal information
- Send your data to external servers
- Share your data with third parties
- Use your data for advertising or analytics
- Track your browsing activity beyond clipboard context

## Permissions Explained
ClipTrack requests the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save your clipboard history and settings locally on your device
- **clipboardRead**: To detect and record clipboard copy/cut events
- **clipboardWrite**: To enable re-copying items from your history
- **activeTab**: To capture the source URL and title of pages where you copy content
- **downloads**: To enable exporting your clipboard history to files (JSON, CSV, TXT)

## User Control
You have complete control over your data:

The extension automatically limits history to your configured maximum (default: 500 items).

## Security
Your clipboard data is protected by Chrome's built-in security mechanisms for local storage. Since data never leaves your device, it is not exposed to network-based security risks.

## Children's Privacy
