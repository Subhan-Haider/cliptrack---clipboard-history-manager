## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Ctrl+C not tracking

**Solutions:**
1. Reload the extension
2. Refresh the webpage
3. Check if text is actually selected
4. Check console for errors
5. Verify permissions are granted

### Issue: Nothing appears in history

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure tracking is enabled in settings
2. Check if you're copying actual text (not images)
3. Verify the extension is active
4. Check if duplicate detection is preventing it (wait 5 seconds)
5. Look for console errors

### Issue: Duplicate entries

**Solutions:**
- This is prevented automatically (5-second window)
- If you see duplicates, they're from different sources
- Check timestamps to verify

### Issue: Clipboard read permission error

**Solutions:**
1. The extension should have `clipboardRead` permission
2. Some websites may block clipboard access
3. Try on a different website
4. Check manifest.json has correct permissions
