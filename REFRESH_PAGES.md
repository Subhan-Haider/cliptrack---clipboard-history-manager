## Why This Happens

When you reload an extension:
- ❌ Old content scripts keep running on open pages
- ❌ They try to talk to the old (now invalid) extension
- ❌ This causes "Extension context invalidated" error

When you refresh a page:
- ✅ Old content script is removed
- ✅ New content script is loaded
- ✅ Everything works!

2. Press Ctrl+C
3. Open ClipTrack
4. ✅ Text appears, NO errors!

## The Fix IS Working

The new content.js has all the fixes, but it only loads when:
1. You open a NEW page, OR
2. You REFRESH an existing page

**The old script is still on your Google search page because you haven't refreshed it yet!**
